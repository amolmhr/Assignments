    "1. Code organization and modularity: Functions allow you to break down your program into smaller, manageable, and reusable pieces of code.\n",
    "2. Reusability: Functions promote code reuse. Once you define a function, you can call it multiple times from different parts of your program. This avoids duplicating code and reduces redundancy, making your code more concise and efficient. \n",
    "3. Abstraction: Functions provide an abstraction layer in your program. They encapsulate a set of operations into a single entity, allowing you to work with high-level concepts rather than dealing with low-level implementation details.\n",
    "4. Readability and maintainability: By using functions, you can make your code more readable and self-explanatory.\n",

The function call transfers the program flow to the function, executes the code within the function, and then returns to the point where the function was called."
