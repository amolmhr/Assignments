    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design and structure software in a way that models real-world objects and their interactions, making it easier to develop, maintain, and understand complex software systems. OOP is built around the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes that encapsulate both data (attributes or properties) and the methods (functions or procedures) that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key principles and goals of OOP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation:** Objects hide their internal state (data) and expose a well-defined interface (methods) for interacting with that data. This helps in controlling access to data and prevents unintended modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction:** Abstraction allows developers to focus on the essential features of an object while ignoring the irrelevant details. It simplifies complex systems by breaking them into manageable, abstract components.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance:** Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (subclasses or derived classes) that inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from existing classes (superclasses or base classes). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchy of related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility in method calls and can simplify code by using generic interfaces that multiple classes can implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, OOP aims to improve the organization, modularity, and reusability of code by structuring it around objects and their relationships, ultimately making software development more efficient and maintainable."

    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a real-world entity or data structure within a program. Everything in Python is an object, and every object has a type (also called a class) that defines its attributes and methods. Objects in Python can be anything from simple data types like integers and strings to more complex data structures like lists, dictionaries, and custom-defined classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key characteristics of objects in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identity:** Each object in Python has a unique identity, which is assigned to it when it is created. This identity can be obtained using the `id()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Type:** Objects belong to a specific type or class, which defines their attributes and methods. You can determine an object's type using the `type()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attributes:** Objects can have attributes, which are data members associated with the object. Attributes can be accessed using dot notation, e.g., `object.attribute`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Methods:** Objects can have methods, which are functions associated with the object's class. Methods can be called on the object using dot notation, e.g., `object.method()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data:** Objects can store data, and this data can vary depending on the type of object. For example, a list object stores a sequence of elements, while a string object stores a sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Behavior:** Objects can exhibit behavior through their methods. For example, a list object has methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements in the list.\n",

    "2. **Methods:** Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the attributes of objects of that class. They represent the behaviors or actions that objects of the class can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constructor:** The constructor method, typically named `__init__`, is a special method that is called when an object of the class is created. It initializes the attributes of the object.\n",

    "In Python, class variables and instance variables are two types of variables used within a class, and they serve different purposes. Here are the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Scope:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Variables:** Class variables are variables that are shared among all instances (objects) of a class. They are defined within the class but outside any instance methods. Class variables are associated with the class itself rather than with individual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance Variables:** Instance variables are variables that are unique to each instance (object) of a class. They are defined within the class's methods, typically within the constructor (`__init__` method), and are specific to the object created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Access:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Variables:** Class variables can be accessed using the class name itself or through any instance of the class. When you access a class variable through an instance, it will be shared among all instances, and modifying it through one instance will affect all instances and the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance Variables:** Instance variables are accessed and manipulated through the specific instance to which they belong. Each instance has its own set of instance variables, and changes to instance variables in one object do not affect other objects of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Variables:** Class variables are typically used to store data that is shared among all instances of a class. They are often used to define constants, configuration settings, or data that should be consistent across all objects of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance Variables:** Instance variables are used to store data that is unique to each instance of a class. They represent the individual state or characteristics of each object created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that illustrates the difference between class variables and instance variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    class_var = 0  # This is a class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, instance_var):\n",
    "        self.instance_var = instance_var  # This is an instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances of MyClass\n",
    "obj1 = MyClass(10)\n",
    "obj2 = MyClass(20)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing class variable\n",
    "print(MyClass.class_var)  # Output: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing instance variables\n",
    "print(obj1.instance_var)  # Output: 10\n",
    "print(obj2.instance_var)  # Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying class variable (affects all instances)\n",
    "MyClass.class_var = 100\n",
    "print(obj1.class_var)     # Output: 100\n",

    "print(obj2.instance_var)  # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `class_var` is a class variable shared among all instances of `MyClass`, while `instance_var` is an instance variable specific to each object. Changes to the class variable affect all instances, while changes to instance variables are isolated to the individual objects."

    "In Python, the `self` parameter in class methods serves as a reference to the instance (object) of the class itself. It is a convention in Python to name this parameter `self`, although you could technically use any name you prefer. The `self` parameter allows you to access and manipulate the attributes and methods of the instance within the class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the primary purpose of the `self` parameter in Python class methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accessing Instance Variables:**\n",
    "   - Inside a class method, you can use `self` to access instance variables (also known as instance attributes) that belong to the specific object the method is called on.\n",
    "   - This allows you to work with the unique state or data associated with each instance, making it possible to perform actions or computations based on that specific instance's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calling Other Instance Methods:**\n",
    "   - You can use `self` to call other instance methods within the same class. This is helpful for organizing and reusing code within the class.\n",
    "   - Calling instance methods through `self` allows those methods to operate on the data of the specific instance calling them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modifying Instance Variables:**\n",
    "   - You can modify the values of instance variables using `self`, allowing you to update the state of the object based on the logic within a method.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value  # Initialize an instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The value is {self.value}\")  # Access instance variable using self\n",
    "\n",
    "    def double(self):\n",
    "        self.value *= 2  # Modify instance variable using self\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of MyClass\n",
    "obj = MyClass(5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call instance methods on the object\n",
    "obj.display()   # Output: The value is 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify the instance variable\n",
    "obj.double()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the method again to see the modified value\n",
    "obj.display()   # Output: The value is 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `self` is used to access and modify the `value` instance variable. It allows the methods within the class to interact with the specific instance's data, providing encapsulation and ensuring that each object maintains its unique state."
